## 💡 Quick Decision Guide

### Should I...?

**Build custom analytics?** ❌ No - Use Google Analytics (free, proven)

**Build custom CRM?** ❌ No - Use HubSpot/Pipedrive (free/cheap)

**Build real-time AI demo now?** ⚠️ Not yet - Start with video, then image upload

**Add more form fields?** ⚠️ Maybe - A/B test first (might hurt conversion)

**Hire agency for website redesign?** ❌ No - Current design is professional, focus on features

**Focus on social media marketing?** ⚠️ Later - Phase 3 (after analytics & automation)

**Get expensive enterprise tools?** ❌ No - Use free tier tools until scale demands more

**Create mobile app?** ❌ No - Perfect web first, then consider mobile
